# Address Book Widget: Qt and Visual Studio in C++

This code is from a tutorial on how to use the Qt framework with Visual Studio in C++. It creates a very simple e-mail adress book widget, and it can be found here:

I followed this tutorial for my own practice, as I plan to use the Qt framework in a future personal project.
